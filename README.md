Austin Animal Control Animal Categorization System

⦁	This project involves developing a system to categorize animals in the care of Austin Animal Control (AAC) based on animal type, breed, age, adoption status, and other factors. The goal is to allow AAC staff to quickly and accurately classify incoming animals to improve care and facilitate adoption.
⦁	The system will utilize MongoDB, and future implementation will use machine-learning models trained on images of animals and data from past intakes along with Dash and Plotly. Staff will be able to upload information along with photos of new animals, and the model will suggest categories and classifications to apply. The categories will allow animals to be housed appropriately and surface key information to potential adopters.
⦁	In addition to assisting with categorization, the system will also track statistics and trends over time related to the types of animals AAC takes in. This data could help inform future operations and outreach. Overall, the system aims to optimize AAC's processes and improve outcomes for animals and the community.

Motivation
⦁	The Austin Animal Center (AAC) is the municipal animal shelter serving Austin, Texas. The AAC takes in over 18,000 animals each year, providing them with care and seeking to find them new homes. Proper categorization and organization of these animals is crucial and can be challenging with limited staff and the large intake volume.
⦁	This project aims to optimize AAC's animal categorization processes through automation. By implementing a machine learning system to classify animal photos and data, staff time spent on this task can be significantly reduced. Employees can instead focus on more critical operations like interacting with animals, potential adopters, and the Austin community.

Austin Animal Center runs the largest no-kill animal shelter in the United States, providing shelter to more than 18,000 animals each year and animal protection services to all of Austin and Travis County. The Austin Animal Center is an open-intake facility where lost and surrendered animals from Travis County needing shelter are accepted regardless of age, health, species, or breed. The goal of the Austin Animal Center is to place all adoptable animals in forever homes. (“Austin Animal Center | AustinTexas.gov”)
